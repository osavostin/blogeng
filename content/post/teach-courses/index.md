1. Introduction
First, I began studying the first part of the course program, which is called ‚ÄúIntroduction.‚Äù At this stage, I focused on learning the basic functionality of the operating system and started getting familiar with its interface, working with archives, and using the terminal. As a result of this phase, I acquired several useful skills that significantly eased my work. I learned how to run executable files, download files from the internet on the Linux platform, and search for specific words in text files. These skills proved extremely useful and helped me better understand why most programmers prefer Linux over Windows.

2. Working on the Server
Now I‚Äôm moving on to the second stage, which is more challenging than the first. In this part of the course, I learned how to work on a server. I learned how to exchange files, run specific files, and manage running programs. Additionally, I mastered the use of the terminal multiplexer tmux, which greatly simplifies multitasking and session management in the terminal.

3. Advanced Topics
The final stage of the course, dedicated to advanced topics, turned out to be the most difficult to master, but it is precisely this stage that helps a new user work confidently with the Linux operating system. At this stage, I had to solve tasks that included not only theoretical questions about definitions but also practical work using the built-in terminal. I learned how to write various bash scripts that perform specific actions. During my training, I studied conditional statements and loops, which enabled me to create more complex and functional scripts. I also learned how to build graphs using gnuplot. This stage of the course was the most useful and interesting in terms of content, and it significantly deepened my understanding of scripts and their applications.
