A formalized language designed for describing programs and algorithms for solving problems on a computer (EDP system). Programming languages are artificial languages. Their syntax and semantics are strictly defined, and therefore, they do not allow for the free interpretation of expressions, which is typical of natural languages. Programming languages are divided into two main categories: high-level languages and low-level languages:

High-Level Language
A programming language whose tools provide a visual, easily understandable description of a task, convenient for the programmer. It is not dependent on the internal machine codes of any specific computer; therefore, programs written in high-level languages require translation into machine code via compilers or interpreters. Examples include Fortran, PL/I, BASIC, Pascal, C, Ada, etc.

Low-Level Language
A programming language intended for a specific type of computer, reflecting its internal machine code (see also: machine language, machine-oriented language, assembly language).

Other Types of Programming Languages:
Algorithmic Language â€“ A set of symbols, conventions, and rules used for unambiguous description of algorithms; typically part of a programming language.

Nonalgorithmic Language â€“ A programming language whose texts do not specify the order of operations and serve only as a source for synthesizing an algorithm to solve the task.

Formal Language â€“ A programming language constructed according to the rules of a logical calculus or a formal grammar, representing a system of rules for generating valid symbol sequences over a given alphabet.
(See also: Algorithmic Language)

Source Language â€“ The programming language in which a program is written, as opposed to the machine language in which it is executed. These can be high-level or low-level.

Machine (Absolute) Language / Computer Language â€“ A programming language designed for representing programs in a form executable by technical means (hardware).

Computer-Sensitive (Machine-Oriented) Language â€“ A language that accounts for the structure and features of a particular type of computer.

Machine-Independent Language â€“ A programming language whose structure and features are not tied to any specific computer and can be used on any machine equipped with a translator for that language.

Symbolic Language / Symbolic Coding Language â€“ A language oriented towards specific machines, using a predefined set of symbols to encode machine operations.

Hybrid (Combined) Language â€“ A programming language that also incorporates tools from another language.

Graphic Language â€“ A language intended for writing and using graphics programs.

Base Language â€“

A machine language common to a family of computers.

A programming language used in a DBMS with a built-in language.

Common Language â€“ A machine language shared by a group of computers and their external devices.

Reference Language â€“ The foundational version of a language used as the basis for specific adaptations depending on usage conditions and objectives.

Assembler Language / Assembler â€“ A universal low-level programming language whose structure is defined by the format of machine commands and computer architecture. Used when high-level languages are inadequate or when highly efficient machine code is needed.

Declarative (Nonprocedural) Language â€“ A language that specifies relationships between objects and values without defining the sequence of actions (e.g., Prolog, QBE).

Imperative (Procedural) Language â€“ A language that explicitly defines operations and the sequence in which they should be executed.

Functional Programming Language â€“ A declarative language based on the concept of functions, which define dependencies without specifying execution order.

Special-Purpose Language â€“ A programming language designed for solving a specific set of problems.

Page Description Language (PDL) â€“ A specialized language for output devices like printers, allowing the use of images in a format independent of display hardware. A notable example is PostScript.

Freestanding Language â€“ A high-level specialized language used in closed DBMSs (DBMSs with built-in languages).

Interactive Technology Design Language â€“ In DBMS, a language for describing technological processes of data handling, including dialog functions with system administrators.

Data Manipulation Language (DML) â€“ In DBMS, a language used to access the database for searching, reading, and modifying records.

List Processing Language â€“ A specialized language used for handling data organized as object lists.

Data Description Language (DDL) â€“ A language for describing the conceptual schema of a database.

Data Storage Description Language (DSDL) â€“ A language used to describe the physical schema of a database.

Page Description Language â€“ A system for encoding documents, enabling accurate representation of a documentâ€™s appearance after output to print or screen. PDF (Portable Document Format) by Adobe is an example.

Knowledge Representation Language (KRL) â€“ A declarative or hybrid language used to represent knowledge in computer memory (e.g., LISP, Prolog).

Publication Language â€“ A language used for publishing algorithms and programs.

Specification Language â€“ A declarative language for specifying software requirements or behavior.

Problem-Oriented Language â€“ A language designed to solve a specific class of problems.

Procedural (Procedure-Oriented) Language â€“ A problem-oriented language that simplifies expressing a procedure as an exact algorithm.

Real-Time Language â€“ A language used to program tasks where computer response time is critical (e.g., Ada).

Batch Control Language â€“ A set of commands, directives, and qualifiers used to manage batch processing of data.

Job-Control Language â€“ A language for writing sequences of commands that manage the execution of jobs. Unlike traditional programming languages that describe individual tasks, job-control languages operate on entire programs and their output data flows.

Common Network Command Language (CNCL) â€“ A standardized language in computer networks for dialog-based data searches, aimed at unifying user interaction with diverse DBMSs.

System Language â€“ A language for communication between a computer operator and the system, consisting of operator commands and system messages.

Universal Programming Language â€“ A general-purpose language for solving problems across various domains, combining key features of machine- and problem-oriented languages (e.g., Assembler, PL/I).

User-Oriented Language â€“ A loosely formalized language similar to natural language.

Menu Language â€“ A user-system dialog language based on menu navigation.
